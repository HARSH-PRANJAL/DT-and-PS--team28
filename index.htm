            <div><p>In this project we are talking about the problem faced by farmer due to lack of agricultural
                marketing of their product. Small and fragmented holding of land is the major reason why Indian farmers are not competent. Because, most of the poor famers have small amount of land. And according to date, the size of the land per farmers is decreasing every year. Dealing with local traders and middle man this is the problem that is faces by the farmer at the last of the agricultural activity. We often see in the news that farmers thrown their crops on rood just because no one purchased it. Due to the absence of mandi houses farmers are not able to sell their crops and get a reasonable price. In this situation, they have to look for a middleman and local traders for business. And these middlemen donâ€™t provide a reasonable price for their crops, and hence farmers are bound to either sell crops at a lower price or just throw at the roads. These middlemen are not only creating a problem for farmers but also for consumers because they ultimately sell the crops at a very high price after purchasing it from farmers. The situation of poor farmers is even worse. The complete explanation on selling process where Salespeople connect customers with the product or service they need. The steps begin well before making contact with a potential customer and end after the salesperson completes the transaction. Steps involved in the sales process are Prospecting, Preparing, Approaching, Presenting, Handling Objections, Closing, Following Up. Importance of agriculture in Indian economy. Agriculture is an important sector of Indian economy as it contributes about 17 per cent to the total GDP and provides employment to over 60 per cent of the population. Indian agriculture has registered impressive growth over last few decades. The ways of transport of food to the society by Food supply and distribution systems (FSDSs) to cities are complex combinations of activities, functions and relations. Technology that helps farmers are through website making, We want to cover these problems related to Transportation.</p></div>
